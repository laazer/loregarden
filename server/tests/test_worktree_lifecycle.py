"""Worktrees are retired when the ticket ends, and after a crash.

The failure this closes is "server restart kills mid-run orchestration": the
row said active, the process that owned it was gone, and nothing ever looked
again. The counterpart rule is that a crash must not cost work — a tree with
uncommitted changes is kept, and a tree whose ticket is still unfinished is
left for the resume path.
